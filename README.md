# Mathvision-ai🚀 AI Graph-Based Solution Generator

This project converts a mathematical graph input into a fully structured, intelligent output. The system generates:

Mathematical solution (split into 3 clear parts)

Top 3 best outputs

YouTube reference link

Source reference
All displayed inside a clean, modern multi-frame frontend layout optimized for clarity, presentations, and hackathons.

The backend uses a hybrid supervised + unsupervised learning pipeline to analyze graph patterns, predict solutions, identify hidden structures, and rank the best results automatically.
